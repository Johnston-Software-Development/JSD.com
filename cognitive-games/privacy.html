        <!-- ============================================== -->
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-700 mt-8 mb-4">3. Data Storage and Third-Party Services</h2>

        <p>The App is built using Flutter and relies on Firebase for its backend infrastructure:</p>
        <ul class="ml-4">
            <li class="mb-2">
                <strong class="text-indigo-600">Firebase Authentication:</strong> Used to manage user accounts (email/password, Google sign-in). Firebase processes and stores your login credentials securely on our behalf.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
                <strong class="text-indigo-600">Firebase Firestore/Database:</strong> Used to store your game statistics, trend data, and (if opted-in) leaderboard scores. This data is associated with your unique Firebase User ID.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p class="mt-4">
            We do not control the data centers or security protocols of these third-party services. We encourage you to review the privacy policies of Google and Firebase for more details on their data handling practices.

            <li class="mb-2">
                <strong class="text-indigo-600">Opt-In Required:</strong> No personal or performance data is shared publicly on the leaderboard unless you explicitly opt in to participate within the App settings.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
                <strong class="text-indigo-600">Anonymous Option:</strong> If you opt into the leaderboard, you have the option to remain anonymous. In this case, your ranking will be displayed using a randomly generated identifier instead of any information that could identify you.
            </li>
            <li class="mb-2">
                <strong class="text-indigo-600">Opt-Out:</strong> You may opt-out of the leaderboard at any time. When you opt-out, your scores and identifier are removed from public view.
            </li>
